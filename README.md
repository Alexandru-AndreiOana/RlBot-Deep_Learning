This repository contains a Rocket League agent trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning. 
The training algorithm used is Proximal Policy Optimziation (PPO-Clip).
The project was also documented in my Bachelor Thesis.

## Abstract
This thesis explores the training and performance of an agent trained through Reinforcement Learning (RL),
that learns to play the video game Rocket League, with a focus
on the 1v1 game mode. In the context of optimizing the agent’s performance in such a
complex and dynamic environment, the algorithm selected for training is Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO-Clip). The study highlights the agent’s evolution within a simulated
environment, achieved solely through self-play. The paper presents the methods used to
develop a competent Rocket League agent, in a relatively short amount of time and with
limited computational resources.
